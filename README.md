# Smart Parking System with Deep Learning at Unicamp

![System Overview](assets/docs/system_evolution.png)

This repository contains the complete implementation of a real-time smart parking monitoring system using edge computing and deep learning, representing a decade of research iterations at Unicamp. To run the benchmarks outside of the edge device, follow the [Software Implementation](software/README.md)

## ðŸ›  Hardware Setup
For complete hardware instructions go to 
[ðŸ“– Hardware Documentation](hardware/README.md)

Key components:
- Parking totem assembly
- Raspberry Pi 3B+ configuration

## ðŸ’» Software Implementation
For detailed software documentation go to 
[ðŸ“– Software Documentation](software/README.md)

Key components:
- A benchmark of different deep learning models for accuracy that can be executed anywhere
- A benchmark of different deep learning models for measuring time that can be executed anywhere, but in our case was tested at a Raspberry Pi 3 B+
