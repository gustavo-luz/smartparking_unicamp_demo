# Demo Images

This folder contains sample images extracted from the **CNRPark+EXT** dataset. These images are used to demonstrate the labeling format and the occupancy detection process.

## Image Source
The images in this folder were taken from the **CNR-EXT** subset, specifically from:

CNR-EXT_FULL_IMAGE_1000x750/FULL_IMAGE_1000x750/SUNNY/2015-11-12/camera1

The camera in this subset has **35 parking spots**. This can be confirmed at **Figure 2(c)** from the paper:
